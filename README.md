### Phase 4: Log Analysis, Security & Fraud Detection
- **AI-Powered Financial Threat Detection**: Real-time monitoring
- **Real-Time Log Analysis**: ELK Stack or OpenTelemetry
- **Blockchain-Based Audit Logs**: Immutable record-keeping

### Phase 5: Highly Scalable Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Ultra-Low Latency AI Infrastructure**: Kubernetes with GPU nodes
- **Ultra-Low Latency Trade Execution Gateway**: FastAPI + Redis
- **Continuous Deployment**: Automated builds with zero-downtime
- **Live Performance Benchmarking**: High-volume simulation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Docker and Kubernetes
- Node.js 18+
- GPU support for LLM inference

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-fintech-platform.git
cd ai-fintech-platform

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp config/env/.env.example config/env/.env
# Edit .env file with your API keys and configuration
```

### Running the Services
We've created a service orchestrator to help you start and manage all the services:

```bash
# Make the service orchestrator executable
chmod +x start_services.py

# Start all services
./start_services.py

# Run tests only
./start_services.py --test-only
```

The service orchestrator provides a dashboard to monitor and control the services:
- Use `r<number>` to restart a service (e.g., `r1` to restart the Data Ingestion Service)
- Use `s<number>` to stop a service (e.g., `s2` to stop the LLM Service)
- Use `t` to run tests
- Use `q` to quit and stop all services

## Implemented Services

### 1. Data Ingestion Service (Port 8001)
This service handles importing and processing financial data from various sources:
- Real-time market data streaming via WebSockets
- Historical data retrieval with customizable time periods and intervals
- Financial news aggregation with sentiment analysis
- Order book data for market depth analysis

**Endpoints:**
- `/historical/{symbol}` - Get historical market data
- `/news` - Get financial news items
- `/health` - Service health check
- WebSocket: `ws://localhost:8001/ws/{client_id}` - Real-time data streaming

### 2. LLM Service (Port 8002)
This service provides AI-powered financial analysis and insights:
- Sentiment analysis for financial texts
- Document summarization for financial reports
- Trading advice generation based on portfolio and market conditions
- Fraud detection for financial transactions

**Endpoints:**
- `/sentiment` - Analyze sentiment of financial text
- `/summarize` - Summarize financial documents
- `/trading-advice` - Get AI-powered trading recommendations
- `/fraud-detection` - Detect potential fraud in financial transactions
- `/health` - Service health check

### 3. Trading Engine (Port 8003)
This service handles order execution, portfolio management, and risk assessment:
- Multiple order types (market, limit, stop, stop-limit, trailing stop)
- Real-time portfolio tracking and position management
- Risk metrics calculation (VaR, beta, Sharpe ratio, etc.)
- WebSocket support for real-time updates

**Endpoints:**
- `/orders` - Create and manage orders
- `/portfolio` - Get portfolio information
- `/positions` - Get position information
- `/risk` - Get risk metrics
- `/market-data/{symbol}` - Get current market data
- `/health` - Service health check
- WebSocket: `ws://localhost:8003/ws/{user_id}` - Real-time order and portfolio updates

## Testing
We've created a comprehensive testing script to verify that all services are working correctly:

```bash
# Run the test script
python test_services.py
```

The test script checks:
- LLM Service functionality (sentiment analysis, document summarization, trading advice, fraud detection)
- Trading Engine functionality (order creation, portfolio management, risk assessment)
- Data Ingestion Service functionality (historical data retrieval, news aggregation, WebSocket streaming)

## Compliance and Security

This system is designed to comply with:
- SEC regulations
- GDPR requirements
- KYC/AML standards

Security measures include:
- End-to-end encryption
- Multi-factor authentication
- Blockchain-based audit logs
- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy

## Performance Requirements

- Trade execution: sub-millisecond latency
- Risk assessments: <5ms response time
- Fallback mechanisms: activate if response >10ms
- System capacity: 10M+ trades per second
