# Deploying the AI-Powered FinTech Platform to Render.com

This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy the AI-Powered FinTech Platform to Render.com, making it accessible to others on the internet.

## Prerequisites

1. A GitHub account with your repository pushed (already completed)
2. A Render.com account (free tier is sufficient)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Create a Render.com Account

1. Go to [Render.com](https://render.com/) and sign up for a free account
2. Verify your email address

### 2. Connect Your GitHub Repository

1. After logging in to Render, click on the "New +" button in the dashboard
2. Select "Blueprint" from the dropdown menu
3. Connect your GitHub account if you haven't already
4. Select the repository `rafeeqqq/XNL-21BCE3918-LLM-1`
5. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file in your repository

### 3. Configure and Deploy Services

1. Render will show you a list of services defined in your `render.yaml` file
2. Review the configuration for each service
3. Click "Apply" to start the deployment process
4. Render will build and deploy all four services:
   - AI-Fintech Dashboard (static site)
   - Data Ingestion Service
   - LLM Service
   - Trading Engine

### 4. Access Your Deployed Application

Once the deployment is complete (this may take a few minutes), you can access your services at the following URLs:

- Dashboard: `https://ai-fintech-dashboard.onrender.com`
- Data Ingestion Service: `https://ai-fintech-data-ingestion.onrender.com`
- LLM Service: `https://ai-fintech-llm-service.onrender.com`
- Trading Engine: `https://ai-fintech-trading-engine.onrender.com`

## Important Notes

1. **Free Tier Limitations**: Render's free tier has some limitations:
   - Services may spin down after periods of inactivity
   - Limited compute resources
   - Limited bandwidth

2. **Environment Variables**: If you need to add API keys or other sensitive information, you can add them in the Render dashboard under each service's "Environment" tab.

3. **Logs**: You can view logs for each service in the Render dashboard to troubleshoot any issues.

4. **Custom Domains**: If you want to use a custom domain, you can configure it in the Render dashboard (requires a paid plan).

## Sharing Your Application

Once deployed, you can share the dashboard URL with others. They will be able to access and interact with your AI-Powered FinTech Platform through their web browsers.

The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to:
- Check the status of all services
- Fetch market data
- Analyze sentiment
- Create trading orders
- Check portfolio status

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the deployment:

1. Check the service logs in the Render dashboard
2. Ensure all environment variables are correctly set
3. Verify that the services are running (they may take a few minutes to start up)
4. Check for any errors in the browser console when accessing the dashboard
